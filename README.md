Solving Leetcode's 1739. Building Boxes

I've uploaded my Java code to solve Leetcode's problem 1739 with 3 variables.
I've also attached the Excel file where I did my analysis and the Autocad file which I used to visualize the problem.

I grids where each number represents the vertically stacked boxes at a position. By counting the cells that have values in them, I got the output for each input n.
Afterward I tried to find a pattern between the total number of boxes and the boxes on the floor.
